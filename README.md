## About Me :computer:
I am a Web Developer by day who works with .NET and Angular. Currently I work for Progressive.

By night, I am a game development working on my own Unreal projects. Video games are my passion. It was thanks to them that I was introduced to C#, C++, and programming in general. Someday I want to release my own titles for others to enjoy.

### Other Languages :speech_balloon:
Besides C#, I am also comfortable in Java, C++, and Python (although some syntax refreshers might be needed for this one.)

### Other Interests :video_game:
As I have mentioned earlier, I am a big gamer. I have been playing video games almost all my life. Practically grew up with titles like Halo, Mass Effect, and many others. Fun fact: I still have a Gamecube as well as a disc collection of all of my older games, including the Gamecube ones. Other than games, I also like anime, movies, and listening to metal or dark techno music. I also like to ride motorcyles as well. I love to go for a ride, cruising in the summertime.
